yathzee
=======

Simple "game" of luck. There are 5 dices that roll at each try. The game ends when
you get a "yathzee" (5 equal number rolls). It counts the amout of tries and the dices number.

How to run
===========
- You MUST have the luac package (either for windows or for linux).
- Run the yathzee.lua file, it will open a lua terminal, wich will run the program.
