yathzee
=======

Simple "game" of luck. There are 5 dices that roll at each try. The game ends when
you get a "yathzee" (5 equal number rolls). It counts the amout of tries and the dices number.

- How to run
You MUST have the luac package (either for windows or for linux), then you compile it:
** luac -o yathzee yathzee **
And the you run it using the batch file in the folder, or typing in the cmd:
** lua yathzee **
As far as i know, it takes 5 seconds to load (just a WAIT function, so the randomizer can work.)
